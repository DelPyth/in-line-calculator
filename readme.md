#### What's this?

A calculator for Windows that lets you do basic math without having to leave the line you're typing on.  
&nbsp;  



#### Where can it be used?

Almost anywhere in windows where you can enter text. Any text editor, search box or command line... even the text edit box that you use to rename a file in file explorer.  
&nbsp;  



#### How does it work?

Type out an equation, then use one of the two end keys below to calculate it

```
5p5
```

The &nbsp; <kbd>**=**</kbd> &nbsp; key deletes the equation and pastes the answer  

```
10
```
The &nbsp; <kbd>**#**</kbd> &nbsp; key keeps the equation and pastes the answer at the end  

```
5+5 = 10
```

&nbsp;



#### What's that p for?

Letters can be used instead of &nbsp; **+ - * /** &nbsp; which makes it easier to type since you don't have to use the shift key.


| math key | key to use if you're ~~lazy~~ efficient |  
|:--------:|:--------------------------------|  
| <kbd>+</kbd> | <kbd>p</kbd> &nbsp; `(plus)`  &nbsp; <kbd>a</kbd> &nbsp; `(and)`  
| <kbd>-</kbd> | <kbd>m</kbd> &nbsp; `(minus)` &nbsp; <kbd>s</kbd> &nbsp; `(subtract)`  
| <kbd>*</kbd> | <kbd>t</kbd> &nbsp; `(times)` &nbsp; <kbd>b</kbd> &nbsp; `(by)`   &nbsp; <kbd>x</kbd> &nbsp; `(multiply)`  
| <kbd>/</kbd> | <kbd>d</kbd> &nbsp; `(divide)`    


Some examples:

```
7 p (11 m 2) = 16
7 + (11 - 2)
```

```
(27 d 4) p (12 x 15) = 186.75
(27 / 4) + (12 * 15)
```

## Other Features



**Select an equation**

Select an equation and use one of the following hotkeys:

<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd> &nbsp; Leaves the result only  
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>#</kbd> &nbsp; Equation & result  


*(This feature uses the clipboard to get the equation text and paste it back again so it only works in places where you can copy and paste text)*  
&nbsp;



**Add numbers quickly**

If there are no math symbols in the selected text, then every space between the numbers will be replaced with pluses.  
`100 200 300` will become `100+200+300`

&nbsp;



**Windows calculator**

The keys &nbsp; <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>p</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd> <kbd>x</kbd> &nbsp; are remapped to send the corresponding math symbols when Windows calculator is open.   
The &nbsp; <kbd>=</kbd> &nbsp; key is remapped to send &nbsp; <kbd>enter</kbd>
